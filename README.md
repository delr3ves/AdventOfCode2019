# AdventOfCode2019 ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/delr3ves/AdventOfCode2019.svg?branch=master)

The code for Advent Of Code 2019 (https://adventofcode.com/)

I'm just using kotlin and I hope I'd also use arrow-kt to solve some problems ;)

As this projects is built by Gradle, you just can follow the typical flow:

```bash
./gradlew build # to build the system.
```

Additional tasks has been added for linting tasks:
```bash
./gradlew ktlintFormat # to check the code is properly formatted.
./gradlew ktlintFormat # to automatic fix typical issues. 
```
